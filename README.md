# Recommendation System

This project implements **data structures and algorithms** to handle a movie dataset and build a **recommender system in C++**. The system allows filtering movies based on specific criteria and outputs tailored recommendations.

## Features

- **Filters for movies:**
  - Streaming platform availability.
  - Year of release.
  - Rotten Tomatoes ratings.
- **Data Structures Used:**
  - Dynamic arrays.
  - Singly and doubly linked lists.
  - Queues and priority queues.
- **Algorithms Implemented:**
  - Quick sort sort for dataset sorting.
  - Sequential and binary search for efficient queries.

## Usage

1. Load the movie dataset at runtime.
2. Use the available filters to narrow down the results.
3. View the recommendations based on the specified criteria.

## Dataset Format

The dataset should be a CSV file containing:
- Movie title.
- Year of release.
- Streaming platform (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime).
- Rotten Tomatoes score.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for filtering by genre or director.
- Implement advanced recommendation algorithms.
- Optimize the program for larger datasets.
